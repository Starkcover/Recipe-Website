                                <p>Prepare the Sugar Syrup:

                                    In a large saucepan, combine the sugar and water.
                                    
                                    Heat the mixture over medium heat until the sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally.
                                    
                                    Add the crushed cardamom pods, saffron strands (if using), and lemon juice. The lemon juice prevents the syrup from crystallizing.
                                    
                                    Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 5-10 minutes, until slightly thickened.
                                    
                                    Turn off the heat and add rose water (if using). Set aside.
                                    
                                    Make the Dough for Gulab Jamun:
                                    
                                    In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda.
                                    
                                    Add the ghee and mix well until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
                                    
                                    Gradually add milk and knead to form a smooth, soft dough. The dough should not be too dry or too sticky.
                                    
                                    Let the dough rest for about 10 minutes.
                                    
                                    Shape and Fry the Gulab Jamun:
                                    
                                    Divide the dough into small, equal-sized portions and roll them into smooth balls. Ensure there are no cracks on the surface.
                                    
                                    Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium-low heat.
                                    
                                    Fry the dough balls in batches, stirring gently to ensure even cooking. Fry until they turn golden brown.
                                    
                                    Remove the fried Gulab Jamun and drain on paper towels.
                                    
                                    Soak in Sugar Syrup:
                                    
                                    While the Gulab Jamun are still warm, transfer them to the warm sugar syrup.
                                    
                                    Let them soak for at least 1-2 hours to absorb the syrup and become soft and flavorful.
                                    
                                    Serve:
                                    
                                    Serve the Gulab Jamun warm or at room temperature. They can also be garnished with chopped nuts if desired.</p>

                                <p>Preparation:

                                    Rinse the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds separately until the water runs clear.
                                    
                                    Soak the rice and urad dal with fenugreek seeds in separate bowls of water for about 4-6 hours or overnight.
                                    
                                    Grinding the Batter:
                                    
                                    Drain the water from the soaked rice and dal.
                                    
                                    Grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds first in a mixer or wet grinder to a smooth paste, adding water as needed.
                                    
                                    Next, grind the rice to a slightly coarse paste, adding water as needed.
                                    
                                    Combine both pastes in a large bowl, mix well, and add salt.
                                    
                                    Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight until it has doubled in volume and has a slightly sour aroma.
                                    
                                    Making the Dosa:
                                    
                                    Heat a non-stick or cast iron tawa (griddle) on medium heat.
                                    
                                    Lightly grease the tawa with oil or ghee.
                                    
                                    Pour a ladleful of batter in the center of the tawa and spread it out in a circular motion to form a thin crepe.
                                    
                                    Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges.
                                    
                                    Cook until the edges start to lift and the dosa turns golden brown and crispy.
                                    
                                    Fold the dosa and remove it from the tawa.
                                    
                                    Serving:
                                    
                                    Serve hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or any of your favorite accompaniments.
